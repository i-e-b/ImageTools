ImageTools
==========

A few image algorithms in C#

## What?

* Q. Why should I use this instead of System.Drawing?
* A. Don't.

Really don't use this. These are a collection of algorithms for my own play and research.

## Contents

Experiments covering
* Color space mappings
* Compound/Planar format conversion
* Image compression/storage/decompression experiments
* Data stream interleaving
* Fibonacci encode/decode streams
* CDF and Haar wavelet tests
* Morton and Hilbert space filling curve reordering
* Box Blur / Soft-focus / sharpen
* Image scaling
* Vector field conversions

## Viewer App

There is a simple image viewer app, like the Windows "Photos" app, but much less terrible,
and able to read some of the formats from the ImageTools libraries.
